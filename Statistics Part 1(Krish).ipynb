    "1. **Random Sampling** : When we choose samples randomly. Disadvantages: Overlapping (Repeatation), For specefic usecase this won't work (Like Data Science survey or any specefic domain survey.)\n",
    "2. **Stratified Sampling**: Population is divided into **STRATAS**.Stratified = Layers. Division of the population basis on **sub groups**. e.g., Cosmetic survey will happen on Women, exit poll will occurr on Men. Sub Groups e.g., Male, Female\n",
    "3. **Systematic Sampling**: e.g., Person standing outside the mall asking **details from the Nth person**. It means, they will ask the details from the Nth person.\n",
    "4. **Clustering Sampling**: We will be having **set of groups**. We will create set of groups basis on attributes. e.g., We are an Ecommerce Company and wants to give promotional activity based on expenditure. We can create set of groups basis on thier expense behaviour. Here we are targeting cluster of customers."
